**Rat's Food** is an exciting pixel art game currently in development using Construct 3. The game takes players on a thrilling journey through various levels, where they control a little rat navigating through challenges in a restaurant environment. The goal is to gather ingredients to create a special dish while avoiding obstacles and engaging in fun minigames.

### Game Story
The adventure begins with a little rat who wants to prepare a specific dish that requires a special fish. To get this fish, the rat must navigate through different locations, including the kitchen, restaurant, street, park, and market. However, the fish is under the protection of a mischievous cat, leading to an epic showdown in the final boss level.
